<h2> üñ•Ô∏è What I'm currently working on: </h2>
<h4> I am going through a Java specialization course offered on Cousera and occassionally working on small side projects. I also decided that I needed to redesign my personal website, so that is currently on the agenda as well. </h4>

<h2> ü§ì What I enjoy (Development): </h2>
<h4> When it comes to development, what I enjoy most is the problem-solving. I love coming up with solutions and uncovering hidden faults. It is incredibly satisfying to run a program and see that it works perfectly, especially if it made me work for it. 
<br><br>
  As for what types of development I enjoy, web development has been fun, but I am very interested in branching out to mobile and game development.
</h4>

<h2> üéÆ What I enjoy (Misc): </h2>
<h4> Outside of software development, my two biggest hobbies are video games and motorcycling. I also enjoy fishing when it's not too hot outside. </h4>
